# 🧠 Operating Systems: Page Scheduling Visualizer

This project is a web-based simulation tool designed to visualize and compare classic page replacement algorithms. Developed as part of my Operating Systems coursework, it provides an interactive learning experience to understand how memory page replacement policies work in operating systems.

---

## 📌 Overview

The simulator allows users to:
- Input custom page reference strings and frame size.
- Choose from three page replacement algorithms.
- Visualize step-by-step how pages are loaded into memory.
- Track page faults and page hits at each step.

Supported algorithms:
- ✅ First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
- ✅ Least Recently Used (LRU)
- ✅ Optimal Page Replacement

## 🧪 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned:

- How OS-level memory management algorithms work under the hood.
- Algorithm implementation logic for FIFO, LRU, and Optimal.
- DOM-based visualization and front-end UI logic in pure JavaScript.
- Designing educational tools that improve algorithm intuition.
